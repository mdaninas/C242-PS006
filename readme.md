# Glusity

Our capstone project aims to develop a mobile application that can monitor blood sugar levels and help manage diabetes. This application will be developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and the Kotlin programming language in Android Studio, without using WebView, AppInventor, or other automated application creation tools. The app will be built in Android Studio using Kotlin, with a user-friendly and visually appealing design created in Figma. User data, such as blood sugar records, will be stored locally using Room Database, allowing access without an internet connection. Retrofit will be used to fetch and send data to the server when updates are needed online. Glide will efficiently load images, such as charts or illustrations, to keep the app responsive and smooth. This application is designed to provide users with an intuitive and seamless experience for managing their health.
