# Glusity

Our capstone project will develop a web app for monitoring blood sugar levels and managing diabetes, leveraging Google Cloud Platform. The backend will use Node.js for core functionality, including authentication and authorization, while the frontend will be built using a JavaScript framework. Predictive modeling of blood sugar trends will be implemented with TensorFlow.js. Development will occur in Visual Studio Code, with Postman for API testing and GitHub for version control. Comprehensive documentation will outline API endpoints and include backup options for reliable demonstrations.

# Week 1 Progress
