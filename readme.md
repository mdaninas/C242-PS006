# Glusity: Smart Solutions for Diabetes & Obesity 
This project is aimed at developing an application that predicts blood sugar levels by using obesity data inputted by users. It enables the creation of healthier life-style choices, especially Indonesians, through tracking calorie intake and sugar consumption, as well as providing future health insights.

# Glusity (Machine Learning)

This capstone project integrates two machine learning models to predict obesity and blood sugar levels. An obesity model, trained in TensorFlow using a Kaggle dataset, feeds its output into a diabetes prediction model, improving prediction accuracy and providing insights into both obesity and diabetes risk.
